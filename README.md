# SmartRoom Project

## What is the SmartRoom Project?

The smartroom project is a personal project of mine that I started after having to wake up to close the lights one too many time. I wanted to be able to control my lights from my phone directly and so it started...



## Current Features

* Interaction with lights
    * Turn On/Off
    * Change brightness level
    * Change color

* Sensors
    * Temperature in the room
    * Humidity level in the room
    * Light level in the room
    * Sensor data can be stored and then displayed as graph

* Multiple interface
    * Full JSON RESTful API (so anything with an HTTP client can access SmartRoom)
    * Discord
    * Chrome add-on
    * Mobile friendly web interface

* Misc
    * Discord Bot for Cryptocurrency market

## Planned features
Currently the only real world interaction SmartRoom has is with the lights, I plan to adding more things it can control (door lock, fans, heating and so on) but also adding more ways to interact with SmartRoom.

### Control
* 3D Printer interfacing and monitoring (Video and reading from the printer)
* Window control (open/close)
* Fan control (on/off and speed)
* Door lock

### Interfaces
* Google Assistant support
* Desktop app (or at least a good web page for desktop)

### Other
* Scheduling to automate actions
* Triggers to automate actions when certain events occure

## Installing

While a lot of thing is configurable and portable to a certain degree, this project is currently not fit to be used by others unless you have the exam same setup as I do.

Sorry!

## Contributing

All contributions are welcomed, since I'm aware that setting up a test environnement for this is very hard in some case, feel free to let me know so that I can merge it into a new branch for me to test or something.
